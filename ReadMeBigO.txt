Dont even read the following if you are not working on low-end CPUs with limited memory:

GPUs and TPUs can churn large dimensional data

Execution time in increasing order 1) lowest and 7) Highest


1) Constant  Example: Initialization of first element of Array
2) log(n)    Example: Binary search
3) n         Example: Linear search
4) nlog(n)   Example: Mergesort
5) n^2       Example: Two dimension Array initialization
6) n^3       Example: Two two dimensional Array multiplication
7) 2^n,n^n   Example: Far and few. Ignore

If you have access to GPUs or TPUs you have immense computational power. Dont worry about processing speed.
Yes if you are working on limited power devices such as inexpensive nodes or motes as in IoT you may want to read further

No body will be fool to use linear search when binary search is available similarly no body will sort using brute force when Mergesort will be at disposal. 

What surprises me is Organizations which always make use of GPUs and TPUs with huge memory talking about BigO blah blah. It was sensible topic when almost all the processors were KhZ and memory was KB (KhZ is kilo Hertz and KB is Kilo Bytes).

What is the need of the hour is 
1) Proper coding guidelines.
2) Redable and maintainable code.

AND PLEASE DONT STRESS ON SYNTAX. For example, I swicth between C, C++, Java, Python and Julia. Seldomly JavaScript too for Web testing.

Rather check for Logic. For example if the person able to give the logic I will not use word Algorithm(Most abused term), you dont need syntax. It is time when we are stressing on re-using the code which is not copy right protected. LOGIC IS IMPORTANT. RE-USABLE CODE CAN BE GLUED using LOGIC to achieve what is required.
